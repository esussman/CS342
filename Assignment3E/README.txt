PURPOSE:

The purpose of this program is correctly identify and 
implement the design patterns needed to create
a software troubleshooting program for hard drives.

PERCENT COMPLETE:

I believe I have completed 100% of this project.

PARTS THAT ARE NOT COMPLETE:


BUGS:

[
  Document here the bugs in your program that you are aware but have no idea
  why they exist, NOT the ones you solved. For example "For some reason, I
  cannot seem to send 4 bytes of data in a package, but when I increase the
  package to 8 bytes, then everything works correctly". Don't try to be
  creative here, if you do not see any bugs, say "None".
]

FILES:

[
  Document here a list of the files that are necessary for the project to run.
  Here is a sample:

  Included with this project are 5 files:

  BinaryNode.java, the file which does the binary tree
  Tree.java, the file responsible for the printing and basics of the tree
  Project3.java, the main file associated with the program also contains main
  File.txt, the file that contains the data to be printed on the tree
  README, the text file you are presently reading
]

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

[
  Copy and paste a recent CORRECT output from your test runs, ALONG with the
  command line. Cut it short if more than 10 lines. Here is a sample:

  [erdil@the_caribbean:~erdil]$ ./a.out topaz 12345 binaenaleyh
  SOME OUTPUT
  SOME MORE
  WOW, IT DOES NOT END
  [snip here] (-> if too long)
  OH MY..
  FINALLY
  [erdil@the_caribbean:~erdil]$
]

TO COMPILE:

[
  Document here how your TA can build your program after extracting your
  gzipped-tarball. (Note: ideally, TA should just do a "make". Justify extra
  steps needed). Be as clear as possible, refer to "... FOR DUMMIES" book
  format. Assume your TA is completely lost, trying to save the universe.
  Here is a sample:

  Just extract the files and then do a "make".
]

TO RUN:

[
  Document here how your TA can test your program after extracting your gzipped-
  tarball. Be as clear as possible, refer to "... FOR DUMMIES" book format.
  Assume your TA is completely lost, there is another universe. Here is a
  sample:

  Please run as: ./a.out <REGHOST> <REGPORT> <UNIQNAME>
  For example:   ./a.out topaz 12345 binaenaleyh
